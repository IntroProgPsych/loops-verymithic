# Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer n.
# Using a for loop and range(), print all positive integers greater than 0 and smaller than n.
#
# Sample output:
# Upper limit: 5
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4

# Write your code here:
n =int(input("Upper limit:"))
for i in range(1, n):
    print(i)
